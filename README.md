# About this fork
This repository is forked from ![catherine-m-breen/snowpoles](https://github.com/catherine-m-breen/snowpoles). Go there if you want a good, clear overview of what exactly this code does.

This fork has all of my improvements that haven't been merged to the official repository, including:

 - A tutorial for getting everything you need to work with this repository set up on Windows (see tutorial_windows.md)
 - Progress-saving while labeling images with labeling.py, so you can pick up where you left off and not have to relabel hundreds of images
